Never eat shredded wheat,

You'll be lost without direction.

The West's horizon will eat

the sun again, no suspension.


After the meetup we will feast,

Git tonight we will teach,

Is the point to head East

to the other side of Long Beach?


Let's go eat some Tacos and talk about how to change the world.
