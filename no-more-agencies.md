What happens when all the web shops close in town?

You become a solo gun for hire.

Do you have Chewbacca as your homie?

Do you have to eat dinner at your meetup because that's all you can afford?

(Don't buy a timeshare.)

What happens when all of the agencies are lost?

Do you lose your soul?

Do you have a chance to reflect?

Do you have to have pizza with veggies on it because Jen didn't order pepperoni?
